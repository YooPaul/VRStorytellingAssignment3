# VRStorytellingAssignment3

This repo contains both the project folder and the build folder. In order to run the program, please open the VRStorytellingAssignment3Build folder and run the VRStorytellingAssignment3.exe file. 

Start the program once your Oculus Rift is successfully connected to the desktop and please be seated while the program is launching. At first you will be located below the water. However, once you stand up, you will find yourself above the water. There will be a humpback whale somewhere in the scene. If you stare at the whale for two seconds, the whale will start to swim in place. The whale will stop swimming once you turn your gaze away from him. From the right controller, you'll see a curved raycast coming out. You can teleport to the location the raycast is intersecting by pressing on the trigger.
